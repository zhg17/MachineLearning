The UFC (Ultimate Fighting Champion) is a sports promotion company focused on the organization and hosting of professional mixed martial arts (MMA) fights globally. Founded in 1993, the UFC is currently the largest MMA promotion company in the world by revenue and paid pay-per-view events. The events are broadcast in over 165 countries reaching over 1.1 billion households worldwide.

There have been over 500 UFC events held since the companies founding and Kaggle user Rajeev Warrier painstakingly collected data from every single fight in those events. Recording data for dates, fighters, referees, win type (knockout vs. decision), winning streaks, and many more statistics oficially sourced from the UFCâ€™s records. In this project we will be using Warriers raw dataset and using data cleaning and visualization techniques using python libraries such as numpy, sklearn, statsModels etc. We will also be performing statistical analysis and a machine learning algorithm which utilizes a gradient descent model to predict winners given certain prerequisite statistics. Our goal is to develop an algorithm to predict the winner of an upcoming UFC fight given historical fight data about each of the fighters.
